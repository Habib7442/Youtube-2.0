# Youtube 2.0

This project involved building a YouTube clone 
using React.js and Material-UI. 
The application allows users to search and 
watch videos, and view video statistics. 
The user interface was implemented 
using React components, and the application
 integrated with the YouTube API from Rapid API to retrieve 
 and display data on the front-end.
